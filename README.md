# EVO
Genetic Algorithm - Graph Colouring Problem school project for EVO class at BUT  

## Used libraries
- python 3.10.8
- matplotlib 3.5.1
- numpy 1.21.3
- pandas 1.3.4
- seaborn 0.11.2

## Running 

The source notebook contains cells for both the EVO project and its BIN extension. Each cell has a comment in the 1st line that describes what the cell is for, and at the very beginning of the comment there is an abbreviation of the subject (ie EVO, BIN) to which the cell refers. Cells without a subject label work for both variants.
In the case of starting the EVO part of the project, it is therefore necessary to start only the cells with the EVO label (also cells without the subject label), in the case of the BIN part, again the cells
marked with BIN.
